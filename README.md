# GPS Board V2.0
This board was designed for ECEN-4350 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Scott Campus), so I will not be updating once completed. 
If a new design is required in the future, I will place it here. 

## Connections

## Issues and Troubleshooting
Version 1.0 board had issues with CAN communication. If this design is reused, will need to add on an LDO and allow for 5.0V to troubleshoot CAN transmission errors.
